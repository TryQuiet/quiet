title: Contributing To Quiet
---

Even though Quiet is completely peer-to-peer, it is mostly written in TypeScript and will be familiar to anyone accustomed to Node.js web development. Desktop and mobile versions share a common Node.js [backend](https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/tree/develop/packages/backend) and React [state manager](https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/tree/develop/packages/state-manager), with [Tor](https://torproject.org) binaries for each platform and architecture, using Electron and React Native and for their respective frontends.

To get started hacking on Quiet, follow the instructions for [Quiet Desktop](https://github.com/TryQuiet/quiet/blob/develop/packages/desktop/README.md) or [Quiet Mobile](https://github.com/TryQuiet/monorepo/tree/develop/packages/mobile#readme). (If you're new to the project, start with Quiet Desktop, as it's more stable and vastly easier to start hacking on.) Here are some [good first issues](https://github.com/orgs/TryQuiet/projects/3/views/4?filterQuery=label%3A%22good+first+issue%22), and you can see upcoming priorities in our [project board](https://github.com/orgs/TryQuiet/projects/3/views/4).

Most of all, if you're interested in contributing, be in touch! Drop us a line at [h@quiet.chat](mailto:h@quiet.chat) and we'll add you to the project's Quiet community and (if you like) plan an onboarding session.
