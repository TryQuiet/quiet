## Running tests locally

*  Install chromedriver correctly before running the tests:

`export ELECTRON_CUSTOM_VERSION=23.0.0`
`npm run lerna bootstrap`


*  Run jest:

`npm run test`

### Locally-built Binaries

To run against binaries built locally (which will be in the `/dist` folder) you can run

```
npm run test:localBinary
```

This passes the `IS_LOCAL` flag and will use local binaries in the `/dist` directory (if the OS has been configured for it in the tests).  Check the README in the `desktop` package for information on building binaries for each OS.  

*You must compile the binary prior to running this command or it will fail!*

Convenience methods can be found in the root `package.json` for building the binary before running the tests.


## Notes

The rest of the tests to be rewritten have been left on this commit fa1256e4d19fc481e316a09523746ce9359d4073

In the current approach, installers are taken from github releases, but in the future the application will be built on CI
