## Running e2e tests locally

### Prerequisites

1. Follow the setup instructions in the root `README.md` to install dependencies and bootstrap the project.

2. Install Chromium:
   - Linux: `sudo apt install chromium-browser`
   - Mac: `brew install chromium`

3. Install electron-chromedriver globally, ie for electron 23:

`npm install -g electron-chromedriver@23`

4. Set Electron version:

`export ELECTRON_CUSTOM_VERSION=23.0.0`

### Building and Running Tests

1. In the `desktop` package, build the application:
   - Mac: `npm run distMac:local` # you may have to copy the binary from /Applications to the `e2e-tests/Quiet` directory
   - Linux: `npm run distUbuntu`

2. In the `e2e-tests` package:

`npm run linux:copy` # copy the binary to the `e2e-tests/Quiet` directory
`npm run test` # run all tests

To run individual tests:

`npm run test oneClient.test.ts`

On Linux, `npm run test oneClient.appImage.test.ts` checks startup URL-handler
registration and message-link clicks in the packaged AppImage. It uses one
client with a temporary home directory and fixture XDG helpers. The Linux
single-client CI step runs it alongside `oneClient.test.ts`.

### Known Issues & Tips

- For Mac: We may need to manually mount the .dmg and copy to /Applications (need to verify exact steps)
- For Linux: The `linux:copy` script handles moving the binary to `e2e-tests/Quiet/`
- Tests can be flaky - use the retry flag if needed: `npm run test oneClient.test.ts -- --retry 3`
- Set `DEBUG=backend*,quiet*` for more verbose logging
- The tests expect a clean state - you may need to clear application data between runs

On a headless Linux host, run under Xvfb and a window manager. Hosts that cannot
mount AppImages can use `APPIMAGE_EXTRACT_AND_RUN=1`. If an isolated test host
cannot use Chromium's sandbox, `E2E_NO_SANDBOX=true` opts the E2E launcher into
`--no-sandbox`; it does not change the packaged application's defaults.

## Test Suite

Current E2E test suite includes:
- oneClient.test.ts - Basic single client functionality
- oneClient.appImage.test.ts - Linux AppImage host integration with one client
- userProfile.test.ts - User profile management
- multipleClients.test.ts - Multi-client interactions
- invitationLink.test.ts - Invitation link functionality
- backwardsCompatibility.test.ts - Version compatibility tests (CI only)
