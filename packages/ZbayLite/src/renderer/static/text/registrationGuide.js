    sentences: ['We\'re building Zbay because we want a patch of online life that\'s controlled by the people of the Internet.', 'Zbay is different from most applications in how it protects your privacy, your freedom, and—in some ways—your anonymity, so please take a moment to learn how!'

    title: 'Why Zbay is magical',
    sentences: ['On Zbay, your privacy and freedom do not depend on the promises of any company or organization.', 'Unlike Facebook, Twitter, Slack or even Signal, Zbay does not trust or depend on code run by someone else.', 'Zbay is “peer-to-peer” software, so there’s no big business lurking in the background, hoarding your data, and no central server for spy agencies to subpoena, seize, or hack.'

    title: 'Zbay can\'t be evil.',
    sentences: ['Zbay is free and open source software, so independent researchers will be able to verify that Zbay does what it claims.',
      'Only you control the cryptographic keys to read your private messages.', 'If Zbay changes in an annoying or unethical way, any developer in the world can change Zbay’s code and publish a better version—and you could easily move your username, data, and messages to that new version.'

    title: 'Standing on the shoulders of giants',
    sentences: ['Zbay is built on Zcash, a privacy-focused cryptocurrency founded by pioneers in cryptography and privacy protection. In turn, Zcash is based on Bitcoin, the oldest and most valuable cryptocurrency.',
      'Zcash is a well-funded open source project with a world class team, stewarded by both a for-profit company and a non-profit foundation committed to making it as secure, fast, private and anonymous as possible.',
      'Zcash is well-regarded by experts, including NSA whistleblower (and hero of ours) Edward Snowden.'

    sentences: ['To sync the Zcash blockchain, Zbay requires one big initial download (23GB). This takes about 2 to 3 hours.',
      'Zbay won\'t run in the background, so it won\'t slow your computer, and you can uninstall it at any time. The next time you run Zbay, connecting should take minutes.',
      '(Moving to the same room as your router will help, as will switching to a 5Ghz wifi network. In the future, we hope to make this step unnecessary, but for now we’re stuck with it—sorry!)'

      'This username gets engraved in the Zcash blockchain. It is forever yours and nobody can take it away.',
      'Cryptography ensures that no one can impersonate you or read your private messages. Saving avatar photos to the Zcash network is impractical, so instead we give every user their own mathematically-generated avatar. '

    title: 'Everything is money.',
    sentences: ['Zbay uses the Zcash cryptocurrency to do everything.', 'Reading messages is free, but sending a message costs about 1/50th of a cent. These tiny fees let us use the Zcash network instead of a central server, protecting your privacy and freedom.',
      'To get you started, we’re sending you a few cents right now. Eventually you might want to buy Zcash on an exchange like Coinbase, especially if you’re interested in buying things on Zbay. (Don’t worry, it’s easy and we’ll help.)'

    title: 'Sending & receiving messages',
    sentences: ['Every direct message you send is encrypted so that only the recipient can read it.',
      'Unfortunately, messages can\'t be deleted, but deletion is not always what it seems. Some apps with "disappearing" messages don\'t really delete them from servers, and computers often leave traces of deleted files that can be restored later.',
      'Encryption under your control offers more reliable privacy protection than trusting deletion.'

    slideId: 8,
    title: 'Channels (group chats)',
    sentences: ['Zbay has “channels”, group chats that can be either private or public.', 'Messages to a channel are still encrypted, but everyone who gets the key to the channel can see them.', 'Public channels have owners who can moderate messages. Nobody can delete messages, but channel owners can hide messages, for example to keep trolls from spoiling a functioning online community.'

      'With Bitcoin, third parties can see who paid who, but Zcash makes this much more difficult, if not impossible, protecting your privacy. Someday Zbay will have escrow payments with dispute resolution and seller ratings. Right now, channel owners can use moderation to keep out scam sellers.'

    sentences: ['Our tour has concluded! Now we just have to wait for some blockchain files to download. Perhaps leave your computer and go have a sandwich.',
