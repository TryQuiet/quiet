  `Welcome to Zbay!`,
  `Downloading blockchain data takes some time.
`,
  `Once that's complete, you'll be able to register a Zbay username.`,
  `You can create private group chats and public, IRC-like channels.`,
  `You can also buy and sell things on Zbay using Zcash.`,
  `You can even earn money, by creating a vibrant channel and charging fees to sellers.
`,
  `Zbay seeks to build a patch of online life that's controlled by the people of the Internet.
`,
  `Zbay is a peer-to-peer application that does not depend on central servers.
`,
  `Zbay is also free and open source software.
`,
  `Free software was first articulated in 1980 by an engineer at MIT.
`,
  `Its articulation was a warning for humanity about a potential dystopian future. 
`,
  `That is, one where sofware companies' control over their users undermined values essential to a free society.
`,
  `In the view of free software's first proponents, the only way to prevent this dystopia was free software.
`,
  `The original articulation of free software is clear, concrete and still relevant. 
`,
  `Free software guarantees the public (both users and developers) four freedoms: 
`,
  `1. The freedom to run a program as we wish, for any purpose.
`,
  `2. The freedom to understand how a program works, and change it how we wish.
`,
  `3. The freedom to redistribute copies of a program, to help others.
`,
  `4. The freedom to redistribute our changes, so the wider community can benefit from our work.
`,
  `These freedoms can be granted in legal contracts, such as the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL).
`,
  `The GNU GPL is politically ingenious and breathtakingly awesome for the world.
`,
  `The GNU GPL gives software engineers a legal, contractual way to grant users the four freedoms.
`,
  `Anyone in the world can build on GNU GPL-licensed code.
`,
  `But developers can only use GNU GPL-licensed code if they also grant everyone the same four freedoms.
`,
  `Because Zbay is free software, experts can verify its privacy and security claims.
`,
  `The GNU GPL also means that if others build on Zbay, they must grant the same four freedoms.
`,
  `Free software like Zbay contains a powerful institutional guarantee:
`,
  `If software makers start being evil, users can revolt, take the code, and build in a new direction.
`,
  `If this happens (it's called a fork) the new developers will be subject to the same guarantee.
`,
  `Because Zbay is peer-to-peer and free software, there is a powerful check on our power as software makers. 
`,
  `Zbay builds on other free software, like Zcash, which in turn builds on Bitcoin.
`,
  `Bitcoin was so incredible because it added trust, and money, to peer-to-peer networks.
`,
  `Bitcoin was revolutionary, but it was missing one important thing: privacy.
`,
  `Unlike Zcash, Bitcoin transactions are visible to the entire world. This is often a problem!
`,
  `Zcash was born to address Bitcoin's lack of privacy, and Zbay builds on Zcash.
`,
  `Instead of connecting to a central server, like most apps would, Zbay connects to Zcash.
`,
  `Zcash itself is a network of people running the Zcash app on their own computers.
`,
  `Every Zcash app (well, every full node) needs a record of every Zcash transaction ever made.
`,
  `If you're reading this, Zbay is still downloading that giant record of Zcash transactions.
`,
  `After Zbay has downloaded the Zcash blockchain for the first time, connecting will be much faster.
`,
  `Zbay chose Zcash because it's one of the few blockchain networks that let us send messages privately.
`,
  `Zbay also built on Zcash because, in the future, Zcash aims to offer strong anonymity. 
`,
  `Zcash is a leading cryptocurrency too, so you can buy it on popular services like Coinbase.
`,
  `The Zcash founders are pioneers in building technology for online privacy.
`,
  `For these reasons and more, Zcash provides a strong base for Zbay to build on.
